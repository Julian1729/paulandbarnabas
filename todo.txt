- Write form error handler to display errors in UI
- Create input-container pug mixin
-- set input width dynamically through mixin (should default to 100% in sass partial)
- Style publisher signup page
-- use new router for "create account" and split publisher and admin signup
- DB schema for users (differentiate admin and publisher)
