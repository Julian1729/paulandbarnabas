Paul and Barnabas | To Do
--------------------

General
- Add language option to admin account signup
- Design database schema for users and admin account
- Are we going to use page specific js files?

??
- Configure browser-sync??
- set input width dynamically through mixin (should default to 100% in sass partial)

11-05-2018
- Style publisher signup page
- Wire up login create account button
-- use new router for "create account" and split publisher and admin signup
- DB schema for users (differentiate admin and publisher)
-- do this by making congregations table (congregation gets made during admin signup)
