Paul and Barnabas | To Do
--------------------

General
- Add language option to admin account signup
- Design database schema for users and admin account
- Are we going to use page specific js files?

- Figure out how js files will be organized by page
-- configure browserify to bundle js files accordingly
- Only run necessary tasks on nodemon reload (https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-nodemon)
- Configure browser-sync??
- Create input-container pug mixin
-- set input width dynamically through mixin (should default to 100% in sass partial)
- Style publisher signup page
-- use new router for "create account" and split publisher and admin signup
- DB schema for users (differentiate admin and publisher)
-- do this by making congregations table (congregation gets made during admin signup)
